        <br>
        <h2>Born: June 28, 1971</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p align="justify">Elon Musk is a South African-born American industrial engineer, entrepreneur, who co-founded Paypal and founded aerospace transportation services company SpaceX. He is also one of the early investors in Tesla, an electric car company, and now the Chief Executive Officer of the firm as well. With a $70.5 bn fortune, Musk sits comfortably at the 7th spot in the world's top 10 billionaires list.</p>

                <h3>Early Life        <i class="fa-solid fa-timeline" style="filter: blur(0.5px)" ></i></h3>
                <p align="justify">Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing. At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar. In grade school, Musk was short, introverted and bookish. He was bullied until he was 15 and went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling.</p>

                <p align="justify">Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a Covergirl campaign. When Musk was growing up, she worked five jobs at one point to support her family. Musk’s father, Errol Musk, is a wealthy South African engineer. Musk spent his early childhood with his brother Kimbal and sister Tosca in South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10.</p>

            <p align="justify">At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path. In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.<p>

            <p align="justify">Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in 1997. In 1995 he founded Zip2, a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million, and Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in transferring money online.

              <h3>Relationship with Donald Trump</h3><br>
          <p>In December 2016, Musk was named to President Trump’s Strategy and Policy Forum; the following January, he joined Trump's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. Following Trump’s election, Musk found himself on common ground with the new president and his advisers as the president announced plans to pursue massive infrastructure developments.</p>
          <p>While sometimes at odds with the president's controversial measures, such as a proposed ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, Musk defended his involvement with the new administration. "My goals," he tweeted in early 2017, "are to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization, a consequence of which will be the creating of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a more inspiring future for all."</p>

  </div>

  <div id="year2" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>1995</h3>
    <p>Musk co-founded online financial services provider X.com, which later merged with money transfer service PayPal. Some of Musk's decisions, such as the use of online transfers on web auctions, including eBay, led to PayPal's subsequent success. In 2002, Musk, who was still on the company's board of directors, received $165 million when eBay bought PayPal.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="year3" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>2002</h3>
    <p>Musk launched his most ambitious SpaceX project yet. The entrepreneur was inspired by the theme of science fiction and decided to develop spaceships that would allow humanity to conquer space. Since its first triumph in 2008, when SpaceX launched the first private Falcon 1 launch vehicle into orbit, the company has made significant advances in space technology. For example, SpaceX has been able to reuse the first stage of the Falcon 9 medium-lift launch vehicle by having it land after the payload has been delivered to both the Earth's surface and offshore platforms.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="year4" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>2008</h3>
    <p>Musk joined Tesla, Inc., a California company that makes electric vehicles. Despite the huge popularity of the concern and some of its models, such as the Tesla Roadster, Musk's activities in a key position have had an ambiguous effect on his reputation. In 2018, after Musk’s controversial tweet about the prospect of making Tesla a non-public company, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (CFTC) fined the businessman and Tesla $ 20 million. Musk was also forced to resign as chairman of the Board of Directors. However, he remained the CEO of Tesla. Musk later stated that he did not regret the tweet.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="year5" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>2016</h3>

    <h3>2017</h3>
    <p>Musk, in an Instagram video, shared the idea of ​​using spaceships and SpaceX rockets instead of planes to fly around the Earth.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="year7" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>2018</h3>
    <p>The businessman left the board of directors of the artificial intelligence research company OpenAI, of which he is one of the founders. The likely reason was a conflict of interest. At the end of the year, The Boring Company opened a 1.83 kilometer test tunnel in Los Angeles County.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="year8" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>2019</h3>
    <p>A presentation by Neuralink was held, where Musk announced the N1 chip, which is designed to be implanted in the brain to help people with paralysis or dementia. </p>
  </div>

    <h3>2020</h3>

          Musk has been married twice. He wed Justine Wilson in 2000, and the couple had six children together. In 2002, their first son died at 10 weeks old from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Musk and Wilson had five additional sons together: twins Griffin and Xavier (born in 2004) and triplets Kai, Saxon and Damian (born in 2006).
        </p>
        <p>After a contentious divorce from Wilson, Musk met actress Talulah Riley. The couple married in 2010. They split in 2012 but married each other again in 2013. Their relationship ultimately ended in divorce in 2016.</p>
        <em><strong>Girlfriends</strong></em>
        <br>
        <p>Musk reportedly began dating actress Amber Heard in 2016 after finalizing his divorce with Riley and Heard finalized her divorce from Johnny Depp. Their busy schedules caused the couple to break up in August 2017; they got back together in January 2018 and split again one month later.</p>
        <p>In May 2018, Musk began dating musician Grimes (born Claire Boucher). That month, Grimes announced that she had changed her name to “c,” the symbol for the speed of light, reportedly on the encouragement of Musk. Fans criticized the feminist performer for dating a billionaire whose company has been described as a “predator zone” among accusations of sexual harassment.</p>
        <p>The couple discussed their love for one another in a March 2019 feature in the Wall Street Journal Magazine, with Grimes saying “Look, I love him, he’s great...I mean, he’s a super-interesting goddamn person.” Musk, for his part, told the Journal, “I love c’s wild fae artistic creativity and hyper intense work ethic.”</p>
        <p>Grimes gave birth to their son on May 4, 2020, with Musk announcing that they had named the boy "X Æ A-12." Later in the month, after it was reported that the State of California wouldn't accept a name with a number, the couple said they were changing their son's name to "X Æ A-Xii."</p>
